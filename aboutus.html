    <div class="about_div1_head font-st">  <h1> Words From CEO </h1><br> <br></div>
   
    <div class="div_div1_sub">
        <div class="card">
            <p class="about_div1_p">"I was deeply affected by the challenges that individuals encountered during the lockdown, which encouraged me to start Baskethunt with the mission to cater for their basic needs at their home. <br>
                BasketHunt was created as I did not want ordinary people to give up on their basic necessities. I decided to bring smiles to their faces by fulfilling their primary needs. With time, BasketHunt could fill the baskets of the people with happiness. Then I ventured into the travel business after the lockdown to provide affordable travelling to the people. <br>
                
                After these successful ventures, I observed that the curiosity about learning among the students was declining with time due to the lack of education opportunities and facilities. So, I decided to carve a path in the education sector by launching BasketHunt Academy which provides online home tutoring to students. <br>
                
                With the launch of School of Interns, I only aim to expand the knowledge of youngsters who have visions and dreams for the corporate world through our quality-oriented internship opportunities. I want them to innovate the future with their exceptional skills and ideas.” <br>

    <div class="about_div1_head ">  <h1 class="font-st">Our Journey</h1> <br>
        <h4>“We carved our own journey from the obstacles which were meant to stop us.”</h4></div>
    <p class="about_div1_p">
        The journey of BasketHunt was started by our CEO Vishal Kumar Gupta in April 2020. BasketHunt is an e-commerce website start-up situated in Sahibganj, Jharkhand. Catering to the essential daily needs of ordinary people on their doorstep during lockdown was the first step towards the betterment of the people. Then we also expanded our business into AI, cloud computing, and web services. These expansions were also successful. <br>
We also began investing in education on April 28, 2021, when BasketHunt Academy officially launched. Education was significantly impacted by the lockdown, and Baskethunt provided students with advanced knowledge and curriculum through online home tutoring. We provide education at an affordable cost. <br>
In addition, on October 7, 2022, we launched the BasketHunt travel agency because we noticed a significant increase in the cost of airline tickets following the lockdown. We also decided to provide people with affordable tickets to make travelling easier and more accessible. <br>
School of Interns (SOI) is Baskethunt’s new expenditure for the year 2023 which is like a second version of BasketHunt academy. The ongoing disregard for abilities where applicants were being turned down due to a lack of educational credentials served as the impetus for the school of interns. Through the School of Interns, our CEO decided to take the initiative and give opportunities to deserving people who are driven and enthusiastic about their professions. His motive is to provide practical exposure for the skill enhancement of these candidates who have skills but did not get the opportunity due to the lack of qualifications. <br>
SOI is an advanced learning and training platform where we aim to contribute towards the future of those youths and candidates who are willing to take the first step in the corporate world. Our main motive is to provide internships from basic to advanced levels in different fields and interests to university students and beginners. The School of Interns is a platform where qualified applicants will be rewarded and admired. We concentrate on honing the candidate's talents in addition to their education. <br>
On this platform, we will give you the space where you can create and implement your skills under the supervision of dedicated and expert mentors.
We warmheartedly welcome you to be the part of School of Interns.
